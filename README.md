- 👋 Hi, I'm a WordPress Developer. For the last 3 years, I've been developing and maintaining exclusively Wordpress sites, though I had worked with other cms too
(such as Shopify, Joomla, Drupal, etc).
- 👀 I’m interested in WordPress, Woocommerce, Shopify, php, css, js.
- 🌱 I’m currently mastering in React, vue, typescript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing sites and plugins in Wordpress.
